### Regrouper

This program takes a list of objects from a .txt file, shuffles it and creates groups from it.
The user can choose either the number of groups to create or the number of objects in each group.
There's also the option to just shuffle the list.
The output will be printed in a .txt file.


  ## Steps:
  - 1: Insert the name of the file with the list (if you forget the .txt extension, the program will add it automatically)
  - 2: Insert the name you would like to give the output file (it will also automatically add the extension)
  - 3: Choose what function you would like to use.
  - 4: The result will be in the **output** folder

Obs: *To use the program make sure to add the .txt file in the **input** folder.*

- *The program reads each line as an object, so each object must be in a different line. Blank lines will be eliminated.*
- *I haven't made any title check, so creating files with the same name, will overwrite the pre-existing one.*
 *It's just meant to be a one-time-use program, so I didn't think preserving files with the same name can be useful.*
