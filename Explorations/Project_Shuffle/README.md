To use the program makes ure to add the .txt file in the input folder.

- The program reads each line as an object, so each object must be in a different line. Blank lines will be eliminated.
- I haven't made any title check, so creating files with the same name, will overwrite the pre-existing one.
  It's just meant to be a one-time-use program, so I didn't think preserving files with the same name can be useful.
